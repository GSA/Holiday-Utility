# Holiday Utility Installation Notes

## Folder Contents:
- FedHolidays.csv – use file to upload to Holiday object using Data loader
- src – source folder created using eclipse on checkout from a dev org; may be used to deploy to another org.

TestfasHolidayHelper.cls provides examples of the function in action.

Alternative to using Eclipse or Ant — simply copy+paste apex classes into Salesforce using the SF text editor.
